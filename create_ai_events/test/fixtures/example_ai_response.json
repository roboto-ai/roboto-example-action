The /proto/executive_operation_state topic shows a transition from RUNNING to FAILED state. Simultaneously, the /diagnostics topic reports multiple subsystem errors including navigation timeout and sensor degradation. This failure correlates with the robot attempting a complex manipulation task while the battery level dropped below 15% as shown in /battery_state.",

The recovery manager published a new plan on /recovery_plan with strategy 'RETRY_WITH_REDUCED_CONSTRAINTS'. During this interval, the robot moved to a safe position as evidenced by velocity commands on /cmd_vel dropping to near-zero values.",
